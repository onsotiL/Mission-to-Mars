# Mission-to-Mars
### A Web Scraping Activity

This purpose of this project was to  automate a web browser to scrape data from the NASA webpage and obtain current information and images of Mars. The scrapped information was then loaded into a web app. Additional coding was then done to adjust the current web app to include four Mars hemisphere images and their titles.  The resulting website is also mobile-responsive

#### The following software tools were used in the scraping activity
- BeautifulSoup  & Splinter: To automate the scraping 
- Mongo database: To store the scraped data
- Flask: Render the data in a web application
- ChromeDriverManager
- Bootstrap components to enhance the HTML
